Dataset 
Datasets are already placed in the DTE folder short for Data Training Environment. All datasets are directly downloaded from UCI repository and are converted to MAT files. 10-fold cross validated folds are already created so to speed up the training process.
This work uses Matlabs builtin GAOPtimization Toolbox, and NeuralNetwork toolbox.
